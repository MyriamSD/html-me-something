            <p id = "paraone"> Hello, My name is Myriam Diabagate. I am a West African girl although born and raised in America. 
                I happen to be married to an East African man also born and raised in America. 
                In March of 2018, myself, my husband and my daughter embarked on our first of many trips to East Africa.
                Meeting the East as a person indigenous to the West was a wonderful and exciting experience that I cherish. 
                On this page you'll tributes to many things that I enjoyed about Sudan.
            </p>

            <p id = "paratwo"> As a foodie, the thing I loved the most was of coure the food. 
                Breads made from flat to fat, meats doused in aromatic herbs and fluffy rices cooked in browned butter.
                Sweets that are nutty, and tangy, and rich. served alongside tea served fresh, piping hot.
                Becareful not to burn your lips

            <h4 class = "para" ><u>Meeting the heat</u></h4>

            <p id = "parathree"> Oddly enough one of the things i've come to love about East africa is the blistering, earth cracking heat that leaves one sprawled out on the floor after a heavy meal, cloaked in a heavy blanket of necessary sleep.

            <h5 class = "para" ><u>Meeting the family</u></h5>

            <p id = "parafour"> One of the most prominent aspects of Sudan is the very large and loving family that comes with it. 
                The sense of community os strong, the laughter of children rings far and wide and what people value above all, is being there for one another </p>
